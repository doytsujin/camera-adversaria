# Privacy Policy

Camera Adversaria ("the app") is an open source Android camera application written by Kieran Browne. 

This page covers its privacy policy.

## Information Collection and Use

Camera Adversaria DOES NOT collect user data of any kind, with the exception of data automatically collected by Google Play. No data is transmitted by the app during usage. I do not collect data. I do not run servers. I do not keep logs. No information about your photographs, or indeed the photographs themselves is/are transmitted ever. 

## Security of Data

When you take a photo with Camera Adversaria two versions are stored; one unprocessed the other processed with an adversarial filter.

The unprocessed one is stored privately on your phone; no other applications can access it. We keep this version so that you can change the amount of filtering on the processed image.

The processed image is the one viewable on the gallery view. This is part of Android's public camera roll. This means that other apps can access it. The point of this is that you can upload this version to social media or cloud storage, it is as accessible as a photo you take with any regular camera app.
